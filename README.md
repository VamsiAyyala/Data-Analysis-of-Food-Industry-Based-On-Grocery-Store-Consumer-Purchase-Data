Problem:
Food companies are uncertain about what types of products they should produce:
1.Millions of consumer purchases each year
2.Purchases fall under a number of different categories
3.Lots of data related to consumer behavior going unutilized:
    1.Social media
    2.Recipes
    3.Grocery transactions and orders
    4.Food ingredient lists currently available on the market

Goal of the program:
1.Analyzes grocery transactions to determine what the most popular food product/ingredient is
2.Categorizes each product/ingredient into the particular growing food industry subdivision
3.Ranks each food category in ascending order to determine which one is the most popular


Conclusion:
 
 Vegetables are the most popularly consumed food product, followed by fruits, then meat and lastly sugar. The popularity in grocery item consumer purchases represented by these purchases are reflected by consumer trends that are apparent in the food industry today.
 Sugary foods and meat are ranked the lowest popularity among consumers while fruits and vegetables are the highest. This is best supported by consumer trends which report that customers are driving their interest away from high calorie and meat based foods to products with lower concentrations of sugar and are primarily composed of plant based protein.
